# Real-Time Community Platform (RTC)

A scalable, real-time community platform designed to support advanced features such as live chat, chatbot interactions, and real-time notifications. The project is built using the MERN stack and is designed to handle high concurrent users (10,000+).

---

## Project Phases

This project is divided into multiple development phases to ensure a scalable and efficient build process.

---

### **Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**

#### Objective:
Develop the core functionality of the platform to allow users to interact within communities.

#### Features:
- **User Authentication**:
  - Signup/Login functionality using JWT.
  - Role-based user access (Admin/Moderator/User).
- **Community and Content Management**:
  - Create and join communities.
  - Basic post creation (text-based).
  - View, like, and comment on posts.
- **Database and Backend Setup**:
  - MongoDB for user and community data storage.
  - API endpoints for user and community management.
- **Frontend Setup**:
  - React-based UI with Material-UI or Tailwind CSS for styling.

#### Deployment:
- Deploy the MVP on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, GCP, or Heroku).
- Use Docker for containerization.

---

### **Phase 2: Real-Time Features**

#### Objective:
Enable real-time communication and improve platform responsiveness.

#### Features:
- **Real-Time Messaging**:
  - Group chats for communities.
  - One-on-one messaging (optional).
- **Notifications**:
  - Real-time notifications for mentions, replies, and announcements.
- **Socket.IO Integration**:
  - Establish a WebSocket-based real-time layer for communication.

#### Optimization:
- Introduce **Redis** for caching frequently accessed data (e.g., trending posts, user sessions).

#### Deployment:
- Update deployment with WebSocket support.
- Perform stress testing to validate real-time scalability.

---

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features and Scalability**

#### Objective:
Introduce advanced functionality and prepare for high scalability.

#### Features:
- **AI-Powered Chatbot**:
  - Assist users with FAQs, guidelines, and suggestions.
- **Event Management**:
  - Live events and Q&A sessions with polls and feedback.
- **Search and Discoverability**:
  - Full-text search for communities and posts using Elasticsearch or Redis.

#### Scalability Enhancements:
- Replace Redis with **Kafka** for distributed message streaming.
- Introduce **Queueing Systems** (e.g., RabbitMQ or Apache Pulsar) for background jobs.

#### Analytics:
- Admin dashboard for user engagement and community insights.

---

### **Phase 4: Stress Testing and Optimization**

#### Objective:
Prepare the platform for production and large-scale usage.

#### Tasks:
- Conduct stress testing using tools like JMeter or Locust to simulate 10K+ concurrent users.
- Optimize database queries and indexing.
- Implement horizontal scaling with load balancers.
- Integrate a CDN for efficient delivery of static content and media files.

---

### **Future Enhancements**
- Implement multi-tenancy for enterprise clients.
- Transition to a microservices architecture for modular scalability.
- Introduce monetization features like subscriptions or advertisements.
